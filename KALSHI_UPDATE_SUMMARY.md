# Kalshi Data Integration Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the Kalshi data fetch script to use the real timestamps dataset as the primary source and create a Kalshi data entry for each game in that dataset.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Primary Data Source Changed**
- **Before**: Used NFL unified dataset filtered for 2024 games
- **After**: Uses `nfl_real_timestamps.csv` as the primary source
- **Benefit**: Ensures we only process games that have verified real timestamps

### 2. **Data Processing Flow**
```
nfl_real_timestamps.csv (285 games) 
  → Merge with NFL unified data for additional info
  → Process each game with real kickoff and first TD timestamps
  → Calculate pregame timestamp (5 min before kickoff)
  → Calculate post-TD timestamp (1 min after first TD)
  → Search for Kalshi markets
  → Fetch market snapshots
  → Create Kalshi data entry
```

### 3. **Timestamp Handling**
- **Pregame**: 5 minutes before actual kickoff time
- **Post-TD**: 1 minute after actual first TD timestamp
- **Validation**: Skips games missing required timestamps

### 4. **Market Search**
- Uses actual game dates from timestamps dataset
- Searches for NFL markets using team names and dates
- Fetches market snapshots at precise calculated times

### 5. **Data Output**
- Creates one Kalshi entry for each game in the timestamps dataset
- Includes additional fields: season, week, home_team, away_team, game_date
- Only outputs games with successful real market data retrieval

### 6. **Error Handling**
- Skips games with missing or invalid timestamps
- Skips games where no Kalshi markets are found
- Skips games where market snapshots fail to fetch
- Provides detailed progress logging

## Expected Behavior

### Input
- **nfl_real_timestamps.csv**: 285 games with verified timestamps
- Each game has: game_id, season, week, teams, game_date, kickoff_time, first_td_timestamp

### Output
- **kalshi_nfl_data_official.csv**: Kalshi data for successfully processed games
- Each entry has: game info + Kalshi ticker + pregame/post-TD probabilities + probability changes

### Success Metrics
- **Total Games**: All 285 games from timestamps dataset are attempted
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of games with successful Kalshi data retrieval
- **Data Quality**: All entries have real_data flag

## Files Modified
- `scripts/data/fetch_kalshi_data.py`:
  - Updated `create_real_timing_kalshi_data()` function
  - Changed primary data source to timestamps dataset
  - Added progress logging for each game
  - Enhanced error handling and validation
  - Fixed indentation issues

## Next Steps
1. Test the updated script with real API credentials
2. Monitor success rate across all 285 games
3. Address any API connectivity issues
4. Optimize market search if success rate is low

## Benefits
1. ✅ Guaranteed real timestamps for all processed games
2. ✅ No more artificial limits (was 50, now processes all available)
3. ✅ Better data quality with timestamp validation
4. ✅ Clearer progress tracking and error reporting
5. ✅ One-to-one mapping between timestamps and Kalshi data
